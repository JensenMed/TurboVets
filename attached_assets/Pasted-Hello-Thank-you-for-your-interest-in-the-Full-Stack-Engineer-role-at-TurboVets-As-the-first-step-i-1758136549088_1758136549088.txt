Hello!
Thank you for your interest in the Full Stack Engineer role at TurboVets.
As the first step in our process, we’re sending you a take-home coding assessment.
Upon successful completion and review, we’ll invite you to a screening call to discuss
your work and next steps.
We’re pleased to invite you to the assessment below. This exercise simulates the kind
of problems we tackle at TurboVets with a focus on security, scalability, and full stack
architecture.
🧠 The Assessment: Secure Task Management System
